<b>flow.ciâ€™s plugin system:</b>

In a flow every step is a plugin. You can easily add, delete, and change their order in your flow.  Adding a new step requires only 2 clicks and no confusing configuration is necessary. Steps executed one-by-one in a linear order but you can change all the steps without constraints.
