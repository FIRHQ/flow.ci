## 5.3.17 Eslint plugin

Eslint is a static code review plugin written in node.js especially for node.js projects. It detects if your code violated the  node.js code quality guidelines and helps you develop better coding habits. 

After running your build, the plugin will return an overview of your static code review including the number of errors, files affected, and warnings.

In order to get a detailed log of every single error and warning, we suggest using Eslint together with the Eslint Render plugin.
