## 3. Build Process

You can trigger builds in four ways:

- [Manual](./manual_build.html)
- [Git push](./triggering_build_with_git_push.html)
- [Pull request](./triggering_build_with_pull_request.html)
- [Daily build](./daily_build.html)

After start building, you can see the status of your builds in the “Builds” menu. On the screenshot below you can see a list of builds, each color represents a different status of the Build:

- Yellow: queueing
- Green: build has passed
- Blue: building in progress
- Red: build has failed
