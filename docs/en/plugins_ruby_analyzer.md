## 5.3.19 Ruby Analyzer plugin

Ruby Analyzer is a static code review plugin written in Ruby specifically for Ruby projects. It detects if your code violated the Ruby code quality guidelines and helps you develop better coding habits. 

After running your build the plugin will return an overview of your static code review that includes the number of errors, files affected, and warnings. 

In order to get a detailed log of every single error and warning, we suggest using Ruby Analyzer together with Ruby Analyzer Details.
