## 3.4 Daily build

For each project, you can schedule one or more builds to run on a daily basis. In this case, at the scheduled time the build will be triggered automatically, independently from the other trigger methods. 

<b>How to schedule a daily build?</b>

Scheduling a daily build in flow.ci is very simple, only takes three steps: 

- Selecting a branch you want to build.
- Select time zone. (We encourage you to use your own time zone or the one that your development team is using. )
- Selecting scheduled time you want the build to run.

Just go trigger settings in the Flow menu, where you can set up the preferred time schedule.  At the “Schedule” section you select any branches from the dropdown menu, time zone and scheduled build time. 

If you want to schedule an additional build, just click add and repeat the steps above.
